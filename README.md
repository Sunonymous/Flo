# Introduction
CallFlo is a simple app for tracking and managing call flow. It is designed for people who make many calls, to assist them in implementing certain behavior in order to handle calls in an efficient and positive way.

Right now, the features are minimal, though they will be expanded upon as my free time allows.

# Keyboard Shortcuts
These are the shortcuts which have been implemented:
- ` - New Call / Reset
- t - Start/Stop Timer
- u - Undo Last Completed Action
- s - Open/Close Settings Panel
